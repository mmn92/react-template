# react-template

This project was created with the intent of grouping common tools used in a React project.

For now this project contains:

- Routing with redirects, public and protected routes. [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/overview)
- Context api used for auth control. [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
- Data fetching using native fetch and Axios lib. [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
- Styling using Sass and applying ITCSS folder structure. [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) [ITCSS](https://developer.helpscout.com/seed/glossary/itcss/)
- Some examples of reusable layout components

The initial idea for this project was to provide simple and quick examples to be used as reference in React projects.
This project is still in progress. After all the planned examples are implemented more complex subjects may be included.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
